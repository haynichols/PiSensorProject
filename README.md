# RaspberryPiAutomatedGarden
  The aim of this project is to utilize various sensors, including DHT22 temp and humidity Sensor, DS18B20 Temperature Sensors, and analog soil moisture probes to record and analyze data to attempt to maintain an environment conducive to healthy plant growth. This will be accomplished initially by controlling the water content of the soil through the use of a DC pump, a network of vinyl tubing and solenoid valves. 
  Continuous improvement involves support for a controlled greenhouse lighting and ventillation system to optimize environmental conditions (temp, humidity, light), as well as thermodynamic efficiency. Other improvements involve support of a hydroponic system, including monitoring and control of nutrient levels, pH, and water temperature.
